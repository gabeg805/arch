# Arch Linux Package Installer

## Introduction

A package installer for Arch Linux that installs all the packages I have
installed on my system. The expected usage of this script will be when I am
installing Arch Linux on another machine and want to have the exact same
packages.

## Usage

To install the packages, run:
```
./pkginstaller.sh 
```

Note: This script must be run as root.
